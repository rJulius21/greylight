            <p class="article__text">
              Ultraviolet blood irradiation (UBI) was extensively used in the 1940s and 1950s to treat many diseases
              such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asthma. The early studies were carried out by several physicians in
              USA and published in the American Journal of Surgery. Upon the development of antibiotics, UBI use has
              largely fallen out of main stream medicine. The modern view in Western countries is that UBI remains
              highly controversial. The treatment is now often referred to as Biophotonic Therapy.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">
              Currently there are no publicly known ongoing studies to use UBI as a treatment for COVID-19. The
              treatment has gained public interest following the remarks of President Trump during a White House press
              briefing on April 23rd, 2020. The President expressed interest in the idea of light to be used on a person
              as a COVID-19 treatment following a presentation given by Bill Bryan. The presentation given by Bryan
              shared information from Department of Homeland Security studies; these studies concluded that solar light,
              high humidity levels, high temperature and various disinfectants significantly decreased the half-life of
              the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">
              The process of Biophotonic Therapy involves blood being withdrawn from the patient’s arm using a butterfly
              needle. Approximately 40 milliliters of blood, depending on body weight. This same blood is processed
              through a machine that exposes the blood to controlled ultraviolet rays. The blood is then returned to the
              patient’s vein.
            </p>
            <p class="article__text">
              Throughout the process, smaller bacterial and viral cells absorb the majority of the photonic energy. The
              healthy cells remain intact while the disease cells are killed and become antigenic. An “autogenous
              vaccine”, meaning self-generated, is thus produced. Microbes in the bloodstream are rapidly destroyed when
              exposed to this “vaccine” and photonic energy. This process is called “induced secondary immune
              reactivation.” The end result provides a new supercharged immune response, greater oxygenation, and a
              balancing of your system.

            Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has
            been making efforts to contain and control the disease. One of the initial strategies to combat the disease
            was to employ contact tracing of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Contact tracing is when health professionals
            work to track down everyone they can who may have come into contact with someone who is a confirmed or
            reasonably suspected COVID-19 patient. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the time the outbreak unfolded and the world learned the true nature of this
            disease, it was realized that the window for containment had passed. Many governments decided that further
            measures such as stay-at-home orders and closing down public spaces were necessary to prevent health systems
            from being overwhelmed. Some governments, particularly those in less densely populated areas never issued
            such strict orders; instead they issued public guidelines for hygiene and social distancing, they also
            continued to successfully pursue contact tracing, much supported by the CDC and other agencies. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the closed down areas in the US begin to reopen, contact tracing is expected to play
            a growing part in keeping the public safe and assuming that health care systems do not become overwhelmed
            with COVID-19 patients. To support these efforts the CDC has been hiring, deploying and reprioritizing many
            assets across the country to further assist in contact tracing. Other agencies such as The Corporation for
            National and Community Service (CNCS) and AmeriCorps are available to assist the CDC. <br> <br>
          </p>
          <p class="article__text article__text--bold">
            The following statements are from the CDC website:
          </p>
          <ul class="article__list">
            <li class="article__list-item">CDC has 505 existing field staff embedded in state, tribal, local and

            <li class="article__list-item">CDC’s Emergency Response to COVID-19 includes deployment of agency experts in
              epidemiology, laboratory science, infection prevention and control, community mitigation and other areas.
              CDC staff from numerous programs and disciplines are currently deployed to assist health departments on
              the frontlines against COVID-19; CDC continues to deploy staff to jurisdictions daily to increase health
              department capacity</li>
            <li class="article__list-item">In collaboration with CDC, the CDC Foundation is urgently recruiting 650
              candidates for critical positions related to the COVID-19 Corps initiative nationwide. These staff will be

            <li class="article__list-item">CDC awarded $1.6 billion to 64 state, tribal, local and territorial

          <p class="article__text">
            Today the Whitehouse held another daily
            <a href="#" class="article__text-link" target="_blank">coronavirus task force briefing.</a>
            After President Trump opened the briefing, Dr. Fauci took the opportunity to clarify some misinterpretations
            that were made from an interview he had done on April 12th. His remarks are as follows. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;“I had an interview yesterday that I was asked a hypothetical question and
            hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulties because it’s what would have or could
            have. The nature of the hypothetical question was, [if in fact we had mitigated earlier, could lives have
            been saved?]. The answer to my question was, as I always do and I’m doing right now, perfectly honestly say
            [yes, I mean obviously, mitigation helps]. I’ve been up here many times telling you that mitigation works.
            So, if mitigation works and you initiate it earlier, you will probably have saved more lives, if you
            initiated it later you probably would have lost more lives.” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fauci then stated, "That was taken as a way that maybe somehow something was at
            fault here. So, let me tell you from my experience and I can only speak from my own experience. We had been
            talking before any meetings that we had about the pros and the cons, the effectiveness or not of strong
            mitigations. So, discussions were going on, mostly among the medical people about what that would mean. The
            first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to
            actually have a “shutdown” in the sense of not really shutdown but to really have strong mitigation, we
            discussed it. Obviously, there would be concern by some that in fact that might have some negative
            consequences, nonetheless the President listened to the recommendation and went into the mitigation. The
            second time that I went with Dr. Birx to the President and said “fifteen days are not enough; we need to go
            thirty days” obviously there were people that had a problem with that because of the potential secondary
            effect. Nonetheless, at that time the President went with the health recommendation and we extended it
            another 30 days. So, I can only tell you what I know and what my recommendations were, but clearly as
            happens all the time there were interpretations of that response to a hypothetical question that I just
            thought it would be very nice for me to clarify because I didn’t have a chance to clarify, thank you." <br>
            <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Fauci was walking away, a reporter asked “What was the date on that?” <br>
            <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fauci responded, “To be honest with you, I don’t even remember what the date was.
            I can just tell you, the first and only time that I went in and said we should do mitigation strongly, the
            response was yes we’ll do it.” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The reporter followed with, “And what did he [The President] do, was that the
            travel restrictions?” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fauci answered the reporter, “No, the travel restriction was separate. That was
            whether or not we wanted to go into a mitigation stage of 15 days of mitigation. The Travel was another
            recommendation, when we went in and said we probably should be doing that and the answer was yes. Then
            another time was we should do it with Europe, and the answer was yes. The next time was we should do it with
            the UK and the answer was yes.” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another reporter questioned Dr. Fauci, "In the interview you said there was
            pushback, where did that pushback come from?” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dr. Fauci informed the reporter, “No it wasn’t pushback, that was the wrong
            choice of words. You know what it was, when people discuss, not necessarily in front of the President,
            people discuss they say, well you know, this is going to have maybe a harmful effect o this or on that. So,
            it was a poor choice of words, there wasn’t anybody saying no, you shouldn’t do it.” <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another voice from the group of reporters asked, "Are you doing this
            voluntarily?”. <br> <br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a strong tone Dr. Fauci said, “Everything I do is voluntarily, please don’t
            even imply that.”

            The global lockdown that has taken place to minimize the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly led to a
            steep decrease in oil demand across the globe. The Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC) were
            blindsided by an inability to sell much of the oil that had already seen slight decreases in price before
            the start of the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            In March began a price feud that started with the nations of Saudi Arabia and Russia, both countries largely
            depend on oil sales as a main driver in their economies. Being desperate to find buyers for the vast amounts
            of oil they produce, a slippery slope of under-bidding each other led to a crude oil price of $22 per
            barrel, it’s lowest price in 18 years.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            OPEC has been meeting for several days to work out an agreement between the nations to cut production of 10
            million barrels of oil per day from the global market. To put that in perspective, 10 million barrels per
            day is about <a
              href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-10/mexico-reaches-oil-output-cuts-agreement-with-opec-and-trump"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">10% of the globe’s crude oil production</a>. The organization
            had nearly come to an agreement but faced challenges with one country being an unexpected hold-out, Mexico.
            The terms of negotiation expected that Mexico would cut production by 400,000 barrels per day. The Mexican
            President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has insisted that Mexico can only agree to cutting 100,000 barrels
            per day.

          <p class="article__text">
            In an effort to help resolve negotiations, <a href="https://apnews.com/5cbd700de930cfbdea411e084d976385"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">US President Donald Trump has made an offer to OPEC</a>.
            President Trump’s offer was to absorb a 250,000 barrel per day cut in oil production for Mexico. While the
            offer has not been laid out in detail, he stated that Mexico would be asked to reimburse the United States
            at a later date when markets stabilize. He also said that Mexico would be able to pay back the USA in
            another form, indicating flexible terms in a time of global crisis. In ordinary times, the USA has no
            affiliation with OPEC. In a contrast to OPEC, the prices and production of oil in the US are market driven.
            Russia has expressed favorability to the proposal by President Trump, most OPEC nations have not yet
            responded to the offer.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            The Secretary of Energy said that the US was already on track to cut production by 2-3 million barrels per
            day. President Trump has pointed out that it would cost oil companies more to drill the oil and store it
            than to leave some in the ground. He also said “U.S. production has already been cut, because we’re a
            market-driven economy, and oil is very market-driven. They’ve been cutting oil all over the place.” US oil
            producers have not been given any official or unofficial requests to cut production at this point. If oil
            producers were to coordinate and <a
              href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/mexico-ends-oil-standoff-with-opec" class="article__text-link"
              target="_blank">agree on a price</a> together, that would be a violation of anti-trust laws in the US.
            Federal or state governments would hve to "mandate a production cut" says Stephen Shorck. Given the quick
            pace of regulaory changes throughout this crisis, a mandate for this small production cut is likely.

            listings that price gouge or make “deceptive claims.” Facebook Marketplace announced a temporary ban on
            sales of medical face masks last week. Hand-sanitizer listings are still allowed, but with the same
            restrictions as Amazon.

            their stockpile amid backlash and a price gouging investigation.

          <p class="article__text">
            Anheuser-Busch has joined craft distilleries that started producing hand sanitizer. While currently many
            distilleries are losing sales of their traditional spirits because of the closing of restaurants and bars,
            many are giving away hand sanitizer for free.
            “This is not an economic lifeline for distilleries,” said Brad Plummer, a spokesman for the American
            Distilling Institute and editor in chief of Distiller Magazine. “We live in these communities. We know these
            people. We’re watching them suffer, and we have the ability to help.”
            According to Mr. Plummer, early responses to an industry survey suggested that <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/distilleries-virus-hand-sanitizer.html"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">three-fourths of the nation’s 2,000 craft distilleries were
              considering making sanitizer.</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has<a
              href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-provides-guidance-production-alcohol-based-hand-sanitizer-help-boost"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank"> issued two guidance documents</a> to communicate its policy
            for the temporary manufacture of certain alcohol-based hand sanitizer products. These guidance documents
            will be in effect for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and
            Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020.
            “We are aware of significant supply disruptions for alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Many manufacturers make
            hand sanitizers, and several have indicated that they are working to increase supply,” said FDA Commissioner
            Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “In the meantime, these guidances provide flexibility to help meet demand during this
            outbreak. We will continue to work with manufacturers, compounders, state boards of pharmacy and the public
            to increase the supply of alcohol-based hand sanitizer available to Americans.”
            The guidance Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the
            Public Health Emergency (COVID-19), is immediately in effect and says the agency does not intend to take
            action against manufacturing firms that prepare alcohol-based hand sanitizers for consumer use and for use
            as health care personnel hand rubs during this ongoing public health emergency.
            The second guidance, Policy for Temporary Compounding of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products
            During the Public Health Emergency, is in effect for the temporary compounding of certain alcohol-based hand
            sanitizers by pharmacists in state-licensed pharmacies or federal facilities and registered outsourcing
            facilities. Compounding is generally a practice in which a licensed pharmacist or physician combines, mixes,
            or alters ingredients of a drug to create a tailor-made medication. The temporary policy outlined by the
            agency does not require compounders to obtain a patient-specific prescription.

            According to some in the distilling industry, <a
              href="https://reason.com/2020/04/02/the-fda-is-making-it-much-much-harder-for-distilleries-to-produce-hand-sanitizer/"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">the FDA could take another step</a> to help them produce the
            much needed hand sanitizer.
            "We are ready willing and able to produce massive amounts of hand sanitizer," says Matt Dogali, the
            President and CEO of the American Distilled Spirits Alliance. The FDA, along with the Alcohol Tax and Trade
            Bureau, he says, "have guidance documents about how we make our hand sanitizer." And that guidance requires
            a denaturant—an additive meant to make the alcohol unpalatable if, say, a child tried to drink it.
            The denaturant the FDA currently requires would terribly impact their production lines. "We make consumable
            alcohol products," he says. "And if we introduce a denaturant into our lines, it renders them useless for
            future alcohol production barring extreme cleaning measures, because we cannot have any remnant of the
            denaturant in our lines, and then sell a consumable product."
            The FDA's requirements have nothing to do with making hand sanitizer work; hand sanitizer doesn't require a
            denaturant to be effective at killing germs. In fact, the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines for
            producing it don't include a denaturant. The outlet

            alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

            to identify who is infected with accessible and effective testing. After early on struggles within the CDC,

              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">a decision was made</a> that would rapidly increase testing
            availability. That decision was simple, remove FDA barriers to allow private industry and local governments
            to participate in the fight against COVID-19. On January 27th, the FDA released a statement to encourage
            groups creating COVID-19 to seek emergency use authorization. On February 29th, <a

              policy</a> was issued by the FDA to expedite the availability of diagnostics. Among many things, this
            policy allowed commercial labs to validate their tests along FDA guidelines and begin using them on patients
            before an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) has been issued. The labs are required to notify the FDA within
            15 days and submit a completed EUA request.

              tests</a> than any other country and the options for testing along with availability continue to increase.
            A few of the notable developments are as follows. On March 12th, the FDA issued an EUA to Roche Molecular
            Systems for its test within 24 hours of receiving the application. This is the first commercially
            distributed diagnostic test to receive an EUA during the COVID-19 outbreak. The <a

            The two US Navy Hospital ships “USNS Comfort” and “USNS Mercy” have been deployed to Manhattan and San Diego
            to increase hospital capacity amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The ships will be used to treat patients who are
            not infected with COVID-19, in order to free beds in land-based hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients while
            keeping the groups separate. During the departure of the US Comfort from Norfolk, Virginia,

            "This great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New
            York, a place I know very well, a place I love.” <br> <br>
            "As the USNS Comfort weighs anchor and leaves Norfolk Naval Station, home to the most powerful fleet in the
            world, she does so to embark on one of the most important assignments of her storied career—serving the
            American people in this great hour of need," the White House statement said. <br> <br>
            More than 1,200 medical personnel working the ship "will bring to bear the skills, care, and compassion
            needed to wage this fight against an invisible enemy," the White House said in a statement. <br> <br>
            "These doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists, x-ray technicians, orderlies, and other medical staff will
            augment and support New York City’s medical community and conserve hospital capacity by treating some
            non-COVID-19 patients aboard the USNS Comfort," the White House said.

            West Coast.

            The nearly 900-foot-long USNS Comfort, which was once an oil tanker, is a floating trauma hospital designed
            to care for service members who've been in combat. <br> <br>
            The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has ICU beds, a lab
            and a pharmacy

              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">Trump talked about the response</a> and also approved his
            request for four additional medical response sites in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx that
            will have 4,000 additional beds, Cuomo said earlier. The USNS Comfort should arrive in New York Harbor on
            March 30th with roughly 1,000 beds.

            The Covid-19 pandemic, which experts believe originated in Wuhan, China during the late part of 2019 is
            presenting many difficulties for the world. One of the top challenges is overcoming the stress on supply
            chains that provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to healthcare professionals. When it comes to a
            respiratory disease that can be spread by airborne droplets (such as Covid-19), N95 respirators become a
            crucial piece of gear to protect health care workers and anyone else who would come into contact with
            someone infected by the novel coronavirus.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Since the start of the pandemic in China, the usage of N95 masks has steadily risen. China produces around
            half of the N95 masks in the world, when their crisis started there was no hesitation to <a
              href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-25/3m-doubled-production-of-n95-face-masks-to-fight-coronavirus"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">stop exports of the much needed N95 masks.</a> The subsequent
            large-scale outbreaks in South Korea, many European countries and finally here in the USA has led to
            somewhat of a breaking point. Adding to the medical demand, the fear of the pandemic has caused many average
            citizens to react by hording the sought after N95 masks.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            To rectify this crisis-within-a-crisis, many individuals are acting quickly to plan and implement strategies
            to both increase the supply and decrease the demand of N95 masks. Government officials at all levels, N95
            manufacturers and suppliers, large industrial companies and various organizations along with individual
            citizens are working together to get hospitals and testing facilities what they need.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            To decrease the demand there are a few strategies, some are brilliant and others are unfortunate but
            necessary measures to buy time for the supply to increase. On March 18th, The Centers for Medicare and
            Medicaid Services (CMS) headed by Seema Verma, <a
              href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/cms-will-recommend-hospitals-doctors-limit-non-essential-elective-procedures] [https://www.cms.gov/files/document/31820-cms-adult-elective-surgery-and-procedures-recommendations.pdf"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">released recommendations</a> that call for doctors and
            hospitals to postpone “non-essential, elective” medical and surgical procedures, including dental
            procedures. The request has been supported by the American College of Surgeons, The American Medical
            Association and the American Dental Association. These recommendations appear to have answered the call from
            Jerome Adams, who is the Surgeon General currently serving under President Trump. Verma and Adams are both
            members of the White House task force dedicated to fighting the coronavirus.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            In many hospitals they are currently rationing the masks to their staff, this includes doctors, nurses,
            aides and the support staff that keeps the hospital up and running. This method will save masks in the short
            term but also leaves those in contact with infected patients at a higher risk for contracting the virus
            themselves. The most promising method for reducing the need of masks is a new style of test that’s being
            developed to detect Covid-19. <a
              href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/2020/2020-03-25-path-for-self-administered-covid-19-test.html"
              class="article__text-link" target="_blank">The test that’s being developed by United Health Group</a>
            would eliminate the need for a professional to get a sample from the patient and of course this would also
            eliminate the need for a new N95 mask to be used for every sample collected. To make the most of the
            resources currently available, Duke Health says it will <a
              href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241520921.html" class="article__text-link"
              target="_blank">decontaminate and reuse the masks.</a> Duke will use vaporized hydrogen peroxide to treat
            N95 masks at its three hospitals in Durham and Raleigh. The gas permeates the masks to kill germs, including
            viruses, without harming the material, Duke says.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            In regards to increasing the supply of masks, these are some of the avenues currently being pursued. <a

            hire 500 workers to help meet the new demand. In order to scale up quickly, they are seeking a loan of
